            Morning! Today's forecast calls for blue skies
            <br>
            <br>
            The sun is shining in the sky
            There ain't a cloud in sight
            It's stopped raining
            Everybody's in the play
            And don't you know, it's a beautiful new day
            Hey, hey, hey!
            <br>
            <br>
            Running down the avenue
            See how the sun shines brightly in the city
            All the streets where once was pity
            Mr. Blue Sky is living here today!
            Hey, hey, hey!
            <br>
            <br>
            Mr. Blue Sky
            Please tell us why
            You had to hide away for so long (so long)
            Where did we go wrong?
            <br>
            <br>
            Mr. Blue Sky
            Please tell us why
            You had to hide away for so long (so long)
            Where did we go wrong?
            <br>
            <br>
            Hey, you with the pretty face
            Welcome to the human race!
            A celebration
            Mr. Blue Sky's up there waiting
            And today is the day we've waited for
            Ah, ah, ah
            <br>
            <br>
            Oh, Mr. Blue Sky
            Please tell us why
            You had to hide away for so long (so long)
            Where did we go wrong?
            Hey there Mr. Blue!
            We're so pleased to be with you
            Look around, see what you do
            Everybody smiles at you
            <br>
            <br>
            Hey there Mr. Blue!
            We're so pleased to be with you
            Look around, see what you do
            Everybody smiles at you!
            <br>
            <br>
            Mr. Blue Sky
            Mr. Blue Sky
            Mr. Blue Sky
            <br>
            Mr. Blue, you did it right
            But soon comes Mr. Night
            Creeping over, now his hand is on your shoulder
            Never mind, I'll remember you this
            I'll remember you this way!
            <br>
            <br>
            Mr. Blue Sky
            Please tell us why
            You had to hide away for so long (so long)
            Where did we go wrong?
            Hey there Mr. Blue (sky)
            We're so pleased to be with you (sky)
            Look around see what you do (blue)
            Everybody smiles at you
            <br>
            <br>
