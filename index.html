        <h2>If you care to know, here's a little bio about me, and this website.</h2>
        <br>
        <p>I am an aspiring HTML, CSS and JS developer.</p>
        <p>I have been working on learning JavaScript for a while now,</p>
        <p>But no matter what I do, I always just seem to forget things.</p>
        <p>Other than knowing very basic HTML and CSS, I don't know a lot about coding, really.</p>
        <p>Outside of coding, my favourite thing to do has always been gaming.</p>
        <p>My favourite game, if I had to choose, is Hearts Of iron 4, but it's roughly a draw between that and minecraft.</p>
        <img src="img/hoi4.jpg" alt="hearts of iron 4" width="500">
        <br>
        <p>My main platform for communication is revolt, I go by they/them pronouns because I'm build different I guess</p>
        <p>I like the military but unfortunately cannot join due to my autism, physical fitness is very important to me.</p>
        <p>If you would like to contact me for whatever reason, I will leave contact information at the end of this page.</p>
